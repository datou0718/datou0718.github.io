I'm Yi-Chun Liao (廖奕鈞), an undergraduate student in the [department of Computer Science and Information Engineering (CSIE)](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw//?locale=en) at [National Taiwan University (NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/). Under the supervision of [Prof. Yuan-Hao Chang](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~johnson/) and [Prof.Tei-Wei Kuo](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~ktw/eng-index.htm), my bachelor thesis focused on realizing resource-efficient tree-based model acceleration with in-memory computing, which is recognized as the <b>best bachelor thesis of 2025</b> at NTU. Recently I'm working with [Prof. Sharon Hu](https://engineering.nd.edu/faculty/xiaobo-sharon-hu/) at [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu), exploring the practical realization of hyperdimensional computing in memory through hardware/software co-design.

Research Interests
======
As workloads become increasingly data-intensive, expensive off-chip memory access becomes inevitable and seriously affects the performance of conventional Von-Neumann architectures. In-memory computing, therefore, represents a promising solution, as processing data at where it resides eliminates costly communication overhead. Moreover, the capability of performing matrix-vector multiplication and sequence matching in few cycles offers immense potential, embracing these opportunities could lead to unprecedented resource efficiency.

My research interests focus on redefining the algorithm design for <b>in-memory computing</b>, and realizing practical implementations through <b>hardware/software co-design</b>.
